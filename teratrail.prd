Great call 👍
I’ll rewrite this **cleanly and professionally**, thinking like a **senior web product engineer + UX lead**, focused on a **beautiful, modern website** (not an app).

Below is a **FULL WEBSITE PRD**, optimized for:

* visual appeal
* clarity for judges
* real-world engineering thinking

You can submit this **as-is**.

# 📄 Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Product Name

**TerraTrail (Web)**
**Tagline:** *See your walks come alive*

---

## 1. Product Overview

TerraTrail is a **web-based walking and running tracker** that uses real-time location data to visualize a user’s movement as a **live path on a map**.
Instead of focusing on complex fitness analytics, the website prioritizes **visual motivation, clean design, and simplicity**.

The product is designed as a **personal, single-user experience** that helps users stay active by seeing their real-world movement as a growing visual journey.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Most fitness tracking tools:

* Are cluttered with excessive metrics
* Emphasize numbers over experience
* Feel overwhelming for casual users

Many users want:

* A **simple and elegant interface**
* Immediate visual feedback
* Motivation without cognitive overload

---

## 3. Product Goals

### Primary Goals

* Track walking/running using real-time location
* Visually display user movement on a live map
* Provide clear time and distance metrics
* Deliver a smooth, visually pleasing experience

### Secondary Goals

* Encourage daily movement through visual satisfaction
* Ensure privacy-safe handling of location data
* Create a demo-ready product suitable for hackathon judging

---

## 4. Target Users

* Casual walkers and runners
* Students and professionals
* Users who prefer clean UI over data-heavy apps
* Hackathon judges evaluating UX + technical execution

---

## 5. Platform Scope

* Platform: **Web (Mobile-first responsive design)**

  * Mobile browsers (primary)
  * Desktop browsers (secondary)
* Orientation: Vertical-first
* Installation: No installation required (browser-based)

---

## 6. UX & UI Design Principles

These principles guide **every UI decision**:

1. **Visual-first, data-second**
2. **One primary action per screen**
3. **Minimal text, clear icons**
4. **Smooth transitions and animations**
5. **Dark-mode friendly aesthetic**
6. **No clutter, no distractions**

---

## 7. Core Features (MVP)

### 7.1 Activity Control

* Start walking/running session
* Stop session at any time
* Clear visual state change between idle and active

### 7.2 Real-Time Location Tracking

* Uses browser Geolocation API
* Tracks user movement only during active sessions
* Updates location every few seconds

### 7.3 Map Visualization

* Real-world interactive map
* Path drawn smoothly as user moves
* Map centers on user’s current position
* Completed paths remain visible after session

### 7.4 Live Metrics Display

Displayed subtly on screen:

* Elapsed time
* Total distance (km)

### 7.5 Session Summary

After stopping:

* Distance covered
* Time spent
* Visual replay of the path

---

## 8. Website Structure & Pages

### 8.1 Landing Page

**Purpose:** First impression & clarity

* Product name & tagline
* One-sentence explanation
* “Start Walking” CTA
* Minimal hero section (map preview or illustration)

---

### 8.2 Tracking Page (Main Experience)

**This is the core of the website**

Layout concept:

```
+----------------------------------+
|            LIVE MAP              |
|                                  |
|----------------------------------|
|   Distance      Time             |
|   0.00 km       00:00            |
|----------------------------------|
|        [ START WALK ]             |
+----------------------------------+
```

* Map occupies 70–80% of screen
* Metrics shown in translucent cards
* Start/Stop button large and centered

---

### 8.3 Session Summary View

```
+----------------------------------+
|      Session Complete             |
|----------------------------------|
|  Distance: 1.84 km                |
|  Time: 18 min                     |
|----------------------------------|
|   [ Map with Route ]              |
|----------------------------------|
|   [ Start New Walk ]              |
+----------------------------------+
```

Focus:

* Reflection, not celebration
* Calm colors
* Clean typography

---

## 9. Visual Design System

### Color Palette

* Secondary accent: Soft white
* Path color: Bright but subtle (gold, cyan)

### Typography

* Headings: Bold, rounded sans-serif
* Body text: Clean, modern font
* Metrics: Monospaced or numeric-friendly font

### Animations

* Button morphing (Start → Stop)
* Smooth path drawing
* Fade/slide transitions between states

---

## 10. Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

* Fast load time
* Smooth map rendering
* Minimal re-renders

### Privacy

* Location data used only during active session
* No background tracking
* No public sharing of paths
* Data stored locally (MVP)

### Reliability

* Graceful handling of location permission denial
* Works on modern browsers

---

## 11. Technical Architecture

### Tech Stack

* Frontend: React (Vite / Next.js)
* Maps: Mapbox GL JS
* Location: Browser Geolocation API
* State Management: React state/hooks
* Storage (optional): localStorage

## 14. Risks & Mitigation

| Risk              | Mitigation                  |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- |
| GPS noise         | Ignore very small movements |
| Battery usage     | Throttle location updates   |
| Permission denial | Clear fallback UI           |
| UI clutter        | Strict MVP feature control  |

---

## 15. Success Metrics

* Real-time path drawn correctly
* Distance and time update live
* Website feels smooth and modern
* Judges understand the product in under 60 seconds

---

## 16. Future Enhancements

* Session history
* Export/share route image
* Offline tracking
* PWA support
* Theming options (light/dark)

---

## 17. Final Notes (Senior Dev Perspective)

TerraTrail (Web) is intentionally minimal and experience-driven.
The focus is not on feature quantity, but on **clarity, beauty, and technical correctness**.

This makes it ideal for:

* Hackathon judging
* Live demos
* Future scaling into a full product
